# Changelog

## 1.4.0

**`hj` now routes to the server that owns your current directory.** If you run more than one
project, this changes where your commands go — for the better, but read the first section.

### Fixed: `hj` drove the wrong browser across projects

`hj` never looked at your working directory. Every invocation, in every project, fell back to
port 8700 and drove whatever browser was focused there — silently, with no error. The only way
to target a project's own server was per-shell environment variables that agents spawning fresh
shells routinely lose.

Servers now record the directory they were started in, and `hj` picks the live server whose
directory is the nearest ancestor of your cwd. Inside a project with its own server, plain
`hj tree` just works — no flags, no env vars.

- Falling back to the shared default port while other servers are running now **warns** on
  stderr instead of quietly misrouting.
- **`hj where`** tells you which port you're targeting, *why* it was chosen, and what's alive
  there. Reach for it first when a command seems to hit the wrong page.
- Precedence is unchanged and still wins: `--port` > `--name`/`HALTIJA_NAME` > `HALTIJA_PORT` >
  `DEV_CHANNEL_PORT` > cwd match > port 8700.

### Fixed: a stale server could hand every project an old `hj`

`hj` is a single binary on your `PATH`, and every haltija server used to overwrite it on
startup — so the last server to boot decided which `hj` *every project on the machine* ran. One
forgotten `bunx haltija@beta` could silently downgrade the CLI for an unrelated, up-to-date
project.

- A **symlinked `hj` is never touched.** Point it at your own build and it stays put.
- Servers **never downgrade** a newer `hj` (recorded in `~/.haltija/hj-install.json`).
- **`hj --version`**, and `hj` now warns when its version differs from the server it's driving.
- `HALTIJA_NO_INSTALL=1` opts out of the install entirely.

### New: pre-1.4.0 servers are retired on startup

Older servers have none of the guards above and cannot be fixed in code that already shipped, so
a 1.4.0+ server **asks** any haltija server **below 1.4.0** to stop when it starts, and says what
it did. Retirement is `POST /shutdown` — an endpoint every haltija has understood since 0.1.7 —
so it needs no process IDs and does no killing.

This is deliberately narrow: it never stops a peer (1.4.0 and 1.4.1 coexist, and once 1.3.x is
gone it never fires again), never touches a running desktop app, and never touches anything it
cannot identify as haltija. When it can't stop a server, it complains rather than failing
silently.

`HALTIJA_NO_RETIRE=1` opts out. See "Housekeeping" in the README.

### Also

- HTTPS-only servers no longer advertise an HTTP port they aren't listening on.
- Every REST response carries `X-Haltija-Version`.
- `HALTIJA_REGISTRY_DIR` overrides the instance-registry location.

### Platform

macOS and Linux. Native Windows is not supported — use WSL, where all of this works unmodified.
